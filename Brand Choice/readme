Brand choice modeling using logistic regression.
**Analysis of brand choice:
1) The career focused segment is the least elastic segment towards price changes of barnd 5, so they are loyal customers of our brand. (small negative elasticity) 2) As we know from descriptive analysis, standard and fewer opportunities segements are not very interested in expensive brands like 4 and 5 and we dont need to focus on them. 3) The interesting segments are career focused and well off segements. As the career focused is the loyal customer, marketing efforts should be focused on attracting customers from segemnet 5. with a small price reduction we can attract many new customers from well-off segment. Also we should react to price change of our competitor brand (brand 4) with certain price strategies.
